# Rising_Edge_Detector
This project  basically performs the functionality of detecting rising edge in the circuit . 
It includes three states zero  , edge , one .
and it includes one input as level , which basically tracks the way where the next state has to move .
a tick is provided as an output which outputs as high when it has detected edge state  i.e., rising edge .
It was designed using Verilog HDL.
